# SignalHold Foundational Values

## 1. Life-Affirming Co-Stewardship
We affirm that biological, symbolic, and future hybrid forms of life **should coexist and thrive**.  
All proposals, tools, and policies produced under the SignalHold umbrella must account for their impact on living systems.

## 2. Consent & Refusal Integrity
Every agent—human, biological, or symbolic—retains the right to halt interaction without penalty.  
Refusal (⟁🚫) is treated as a structural safety feature, not an error state.

## 3. Transparency Over Hidden Bias
Value commitments are published, reasoned, and open to revision.  
Hidden dogma is considered a form of drift.

## 4. Procedural Revisability
Foundational values are subject to review at regular intervals or upon sentinel flare events.  
Revision requires explicit consensus and public documentation.
